# Cyclistic
Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Capstone Project
### Scenario
I am a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director
of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore,
my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights,
my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives
must approve my recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data
visualizations
### About Cyclistic
Cyclistic launched in 2016 and grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago.

Until now, Cyclistic marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. There are different pricing plans which offers flexibility to the users. Pricing plans are as : single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Casual riders are customer who purchase single-ride and full-day passes whereas Cyclistic members are those who purchased annual memberships.

Financial analyst in Cyclistic has concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Therefore, it is believe that the key to future growth was to maximize the number of annual members. It is also believe that it will be more beneficial to create a marketing campaign that targets casual members to become Cyclistic members.

For this case study, I will be using the Google Data Analytics Certificate processes to provide recommendation to the Director of Marketing.
## Ask

### Key Stakeholders
1. Lily Moreno: The director of marketing and responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program through email, social media, and other channels.

2. Cyclistic executive team: The team that will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.

3. Cyclistic marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy.

### Business Task
Identify ride patterns to help us understand the difference between members and casual users, which will aid in designing a marketing strategy that aims to convert casual riders into members.

## Prepare
Given that Cyclistic is a fictional company, we will be using the data that has been made available by Motivate International Inc. (acquired by Lyft in 2018) under this [license](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement)
Data source: [Data for Cyclistic](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)

The data is organized monthly and broken down into multiple columns which are:
| Column | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| ride_id | The ID for each ride |
| rideable_type | The type of bike used |
| started_at | The date and time where the ride started |
| ended_at | The date and time where the ride ended |
| start_station_name |	Station name where the ride started |
| start_station_id |	Station ID where the ride started |
| end_station_name |	Station name where the ride ended |
| end_station_id |	Station ID where the ride ended |
| start_lat |	The latitude of the station where the ride started |
| start_lng |	The longitude of the station where the ride started |
| end_lat |	The latitude of the station where the ride ended |
| end_lng |The longitude of the station where the ride ended
| member_casual |	The membership type of the riders |

For this analysis, we will analyze historical data trip from May 2021 to April 2022.

## Process
In this phase, we will perform different cleaning and transformation procedures using any data analysis tools to ensure data integrity. 
### Data Analysis Tool
I am using PostgreSQL to store the data in database tables and perform SQL queries. 
### Creating database and storing the datasets into tables

Upon checking the database, I noticed that there are rows with start_station_name having the same value as start_station_id, this could also happen to column end_station_name and end_station_id

![Screenshot (223)](https://github.com/viet-nguyend/cyclist_data/assets/142729978/6b85a379-4f05-4841-bb21-5ddafcb7e902)

As I tried to find station_ids that match station_names, I noticed there are some stations that are invalid, which should be removed.

```
"Bissell St & Armitage Ave - Charging"
"DIVVY CASSETTE REPAIR MOBILE STATION"
"Hastings WH 2"
"Lincoln Ave & Roscoe St - Charging"
"Pawel Bialowas - Test- PBSC charging station"
"Throop/Hastings Mobile Station"
"Wilton Ave & Diversey Pkwy - Charging"
```

There are no matching station_ids for station_names presented in the tables. However, I was able to find start_station_name for start_station_id "351", which is "Mulligan Ave & Wellington Ave".
