# Scenario
I am a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director
of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore,
my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights,
my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives
must approve my recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data
visualizations
## About Cyclistic
Cyclistic launched in 2016 and grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago.

Until now, Cyclistic marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. There are different pricing plans which offers flexibility to the users. Pricing plans are as : single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Casual riders are customer who purchase single-ride and full-day passes whereas Cyclistic members are those who purchased annual memberships.

Financial analyst in Cyclistic has concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Therefore, it is believe that the key to future growth was to maximize the number of annual members. It is also believe that it will be more beneficial to create a marketing campaign that targets casual members to become Cyclistic members.

For this case study, I will be using the Google Data Analytics Certificate processes to provide recommendation to the Director of Marketing.
