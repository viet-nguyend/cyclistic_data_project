# Cyclistic
Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Capstone Project
### Scenario
I am a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director
of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore,
my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights,
my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives
must approve my recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data
visualizations
### About Cyclistic
Cyclistic launched in 2016 and grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago.

Until now, Cyclistic marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. There are different pricing plans which offers flexibility to the users. Pricing plans are as : single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Casual riders are customer who purchase single-ride and full-day passes whereas Cyclistic members are those who purchased annual memberships.

Financial analyst in Cyclistic has concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Therefore, it is believe that the key to future growth was to maximize the number of annual members. It is also believe that it will be more beneficial to create a marketing campaign that targets casual members to become Cyclistic members.

For this case study, I will be using the Google Data Analytics Certificate processes to provide recommendation to the Director of Marketing.
## Ask

### Key Stakeholders
1. Lily Moreno: The director of marketing and responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program through email, social media, and other channels.

2. Cyclistic executive team: The team that will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.

3. Cyclistic marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy.

### Business Task
Identify ride patterns to help us understand the difference between members and casual users, which will aid in designing a marketing strategy that aims to convert casual riders into members.

## Prepare
Given that Cyclistic is a fictional company, we will be using the data that has been made available by Motivate International Inc. (acquired by Lyft in 2018) under this [license](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement)

Data source: [Data for Cyclistic](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)

The data is organized monthly and broken down into multiple columns which are:
| Column | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| ride_id | The ID for each ride |
| rideable_type | The type of bike used |
| started_at | The date and time where the ride started |
| ended_at | The date and time where the ride ended |
| start_station_name |	Station name where the ride started |
| start_station_id |	Station ID where the ride started |
| end_station_name |	Station name where the ride ended |
| end_station_id |	Station ID where the ride ended |
| start_lat |	The latitude of the station where the ride started |
| start_lng |	The longitude of the station where the ride started |
| end_lat |	The latitude of the station where the ride ended |
| end_lng |The longitude of the station where the ride ended
| member_casual |	The membership type of the riders |

For this analysis, we will analyze historical data trip from May 2021 to April 2022.

## Process
In this phase, we will perform different cleaning and transformation procedures using any data analysis tools to ensure data integrity. 
### Data Analysis Tool
I am using PostgreSQL to store the data in database tables and perform SQL queries. 
### Creating database and storing the datasets into tables

</details>

When checking for ride duration, I found that there are rides with negative ride duration, this indicates that the ride ended earlier than it started, which is not possible. At the same time, I would also check for rides with a ride duration of over 24 hours (86400 seconds), because it is considered a lost or stolen bike arcording to this article [link](https://help.divvybikes.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033484791-What-if-I-keep-a-bike-out-too-long-) 

First, I will create a column that will hold the value of the difference between the started_at datetime and the ended_at datetime. 

<details>

			((DATE_PART('Hour', ended_at - started_at)) * 60 * 60) + 
			(DATE_PART('Minute', ended_at - started_at)) * 60 + 
			(DATE_PART('Second', ended_at - started_at)) as ride_duration

where  ride_length < 0 or ride_length > 86400

select started_at, ended_at, ride_duration
from ride_length
where  ride_duration < 60
```
</details>


Upon checking the database, I noticed that there are rows with start_station_name having the same value as start_station_id, this could also happen to column end_station_name and end_station_id

![Screenshot (223)](https://github.com/viet-nguyend/cyclist_data/assets/142729978/6b85a379-4f05-4841-bb21-5ddafcb7e902)

As I tried to find station_ids that match station_names, I noticed there are some stations that are invalid, which should be removed.

```
'Bissell St & Armitage Ave - Charging'
'DIVVY CASSETTE REPAIR MOBILE STATION'
'Hastings WH 2'
'Lincoln Ave & Roscoe St - Charging'
'Pawel Bialowas - Test- PBSC charging station'
'Throop/Hastings Mobile Station'
'Wilton Ave & Diversey Pkwy - Charging'
'Base - 2132 W Hubbard Warehouse'
```

There are no matching station_ids for station_names presented in the tables. However, I was able to find start_station_name for start_station_id "351", which is "Mulligan Ave & Wellington Ave".

## Analyze

In this phase, we will do descriptive statistics, perform calculations, and analyze data to find patterns, relationships, and trends. 

### Descriptive Statistics

We will first look at the modes of our rider types, bike types, stations, and temporal columns.

<details>
  <summary>Show SQL query</summary>
	
```sql
with ride_mode as (
	select ride_id, (case when date_part('Hour',started_at) in (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11) then 'morning'
				when date_part('Hour',started_at) in (12,13,14,15,16,17) then 'afternoon'
				when date_part('Hour',started_at) in (18,19,20,21,22,23) then 'evening'
				end) as pod,
			(case when date_part('Month',started_at) in (11, 12, 1) then 'winter'
				when date_part('Month',started_at) in (2, 3, 4) then 'spring'
				when date_part('Month',started_at) in (5, 6, 7) then 'summer'
				when date_part('Month',started_at) in (8, 9, 10) then 'autumn'
				end) as ss,
			to_char(started_at, 'day') as dow,
			date_part('Month', started_at) as month,
			date_part('Hour', started_at) as hour
	from cyclistic_data)

select count(cyclistic_data.ride_id) as num_of_ride,
	mode() within group (order by rideable_type) as mode_rideable_type,
	mode() within group (order by member_casual) as mode_member_casual,
	mode() within group (order by start_station_name) as mode_start_station_name,
	mode() within group (order by end_station_name) as mode_end_station_name,

	mode() within group (order by ride_mode.dow) as mode_dow,
	mode() within group (order by ride_mode.month) as mode_month,
	mode() within group (order by ride_mode.hour) as mode_hour
from cyclistic_data
left join ride_mode
on cyclistic_data.ride_id = ride_mode.ride_id
```

Based on the image above, we can infer the following:

- Members did more bike rides than casual members
- The most preferred bike type is an classic bike
- Streeter Dr and Grand Ave is the favorite start and end station
- The peak season is Autumn season
- The peak month is July
- The peak day is Saturday
- The peak part of day is Afternoon and the peak hour is 5 PM

<details>
  <summary>Show SQL query</summary>

```sql
with ride_length as (
select ride_id,
	((DATE_PART('Day', ended_at - started_at)) * 24 * 60) + 
	((DATE_PART('Hour', ended_at - started_at)) * 60) + 
	(DATE_PART('Minute', ended_at - started_at)) as ride_length_min
from cyclistic_data)

select count(ride_id) as num_of_ride,
		avg(ride_length_min) as avg_ride_length,
		stddev_samp(ride_length_min) as std,
		max(ride_length_min) as max,
		min(ride_length_min) as min,
		(select distinct percentile_cont(0.25) within group (order by ride_length_min) as percentile_25 from ride_length),
  		(select distinct percentile_cont(0.50) within group (order by ride_length_min) as percentile_50 from ride_length),
  		(select distinct percentile_cont(0.75) within group (order by ride_length_min) as percentile_75 from ride_length),
  		(select distinct percentile_cont(0.95) within group (order by ride_length_min) as percentile_95 from ride_length)
from ride_length
```

Based on the image above, we can infer that:

- The average ride duration is 18.97 minutes, which says that most riders use the service for short trips.
- The shortest ride duration is 1 minute and the longest ride duration is 1438 which is almost 24 hours.
- Based on the percentile data, most of the rides in this annual dataset fall below 20 minutes, which further supports the first statement.
- Only 5% of the ride has more than 30 minutes of ride

### Rides distribution

```sql
with ride_length as (
select ride_id, member_casual, ((DATE_PART('Day', ended_at - started_at)) * 24 * 60) + 
	((DATE_PART('Hour', ended_at - started_at)) * 60) + 
	(DATE_PART('Minute', ended_at - started_at)) as ride_length_min
from cyclistic_data)

select member_casual, count(ride_id), avg(ride_length_min)
from ride_length
group by member_casual
```

![Screenshot (256)](https://github.com/viet-nguyend/cyclistic_data_project/assets/142729978/89fe9ec2-a6ad-4e1d-9f65-816ecd72817c)

According to the table, members did more ride than casual riders, this is true cause members usually get more benefit and better service. However, the average duration for a ride of a casual rider is higher than that of a member. To get a clearer picture regarding this pattern, futher analysis is recommended


- Rides distribution by types and member_casual

```sql
with ride_distribution as (
select ride_id, member_casual, rideable_type, 
	((DATE_PART('Day', ended_at - started_at)) * 24 * 60) + 
	((DATE_PART('Hour', ended_at - started_at)) * 60) + 
	(DATE_PART('Minute', ended_at - started_at)) as ride_length_min
from cyclistic_data)

select count(ride_id) as num_of_ride, member_casual, rideable_type, avg(ride_length_min)
from ride_distribution
group by member_casual, rideable_type
order by count(ride_id) desc
```

![Screenshot (257)](https://github.com/viet-nguyend/cyclistic_data_project/assets/142729978/4f51f1ba-85bf-4d37-9fb3-20c2fd11ff9e)

From the table, we can infer that members only used classic bike and electric bike. Moreover, there is a pattern with member did more rides than casual riders, but the average time for a ride of a casual rider is always higher than that of a member. This is because...


- Rides distribution by hours and days

```sql
select member_casual,
	to_char(started_at,'day') as day_of_week,
	date_part('Hour', started_at) as hour,
	count(ride_id) as num_of_ride
from cyclistic_data
where member_casual = 'member'
group by member_casual, day_of_week, hour
order by count(ride_id) desc


select member_casual,

```sql
with ride_distribution as (select ride_id, member_casual, to_char(started_at,'day') as day_of_week,
				(((DATE_PART('Day', ended_at - started_at)) * 24 * 60) +

Member: According to the table, most rides are on weekday from Monday to Friday, usually in the afternoon from 4 pm and in the morning from 7 pm, which are rush hours when people start and end their day. The number of rides starts increasing from Monday and reaches its peak on Wednesday, and then consitently decrease from Thursday to Sunday. Regarding the average time of bike usage of member, the average duration which members using bikes shows relatively similar from Monday to Thursday, approximately 11 minutes, whereas on the weekend the average time members spend cycling increase gradually from 12 minutes on Friday to 14 minutes on Sunday. This suggests that members mainly use bicycles as a mean of transporation for work and school, because most rides are usually at rush hours on weekday. On the contrary to the number of rides and the average duration on weekday, the average time for using bikes on the weekend shows a rise but the number or rides decrease, which indicates that the purpose of bike usage by member on the weekend are for recreational activities.

Casual: opposite with the figure for member, the number of rides done by casual riders is considerably low from monday to thursday mostly below 300000 rides, for the weekend, the number starts increasing significantly to over 450000 rides. Futhermore, most rides usually started in the afternoon from 12pm to 17pm. In terms of the average cycling duration of casual users, the average time a casual users using bikes starts increasing on thursday, rise significantly from 25 minutes on friday to 31 minutes on sunday, which is also the highest time of bike usage by casual riders. With a high number of rides and the average time, this infer that casual riders use bike to relax on the weekend or do fun activities.

In summary, member and casual riders tend to ride in the afternoon and evening. While most of the rides done by member is on weekday, the figure for casual riders shows the opposite with most of the rides done on the weekend. 

- Rides distributrion by month

```sql
with ride_distribution as (select ride_id, member_casual, date_part('month', started_at) as month,
				(((DATE_PART('Day', ended_at - started_at)) * 24 * 60) + 
				((DATE_PART('Hour', ended_at - started_at)) * 60) +
				(DATE_PART('Minute', ended_at - started_at))) as ride_length_min
			from cyclistic_data)

select month,
		member_casual,
		count(ride_id) as num_of_ride,
		avg(ride_length_min) as avg_ride_length
from ride_distribution
where member_casual = 'member'
group by member_casual, month
order by month


with ride_distribution as (select ride_id, member_casual, date_part('month', started_at) as month,
				(((DATE_PART('Day', ended_at - started_at)) * 24 * 60) + 
				((DATE_PART('Hour', ended_at - started_at)) * 60) +
				(DATE_PART('Minute', ended_at - started_at))) as ride_length_min
			from cyclistic_data)

select month,

Member: most rides done by members focus in summer and fall, which is in may, june, july, august, September and October with number of rides of each month is over 200000, while the rest is below 200000. 

Casual: similar to member, fall and summer all two seasons with the most number of rides. However, the average duration for each month shows significant fluctuations with a wider range from 17 minnutes to 32 minutes.

In general, both member and casual riders prefer to ride in the summer and fall.

- Top bike station

member

```sql
select member_casual,
		start_station_name,
		count(ride_id) as num_of_ride
from cyclistic_data

According to the table, start and end station Kingsbury St & Kinzie St has the most rides, and almost all of the ride has the same start and end station, which explains that most of the trip that members took are round trips. 

casual ride

```sql
select member_casual,
		start_station_name,
		count(ride_id) as num_of_ride
from cyclistic_data
where member_casual = 'casual'
group by member_casual, start_station_name

For casual riders, most rides started and ended at the same station, Streeter Dr & Grand Ave. This is similar to member, which mean that most of the rides done by casual riders are round trips.
